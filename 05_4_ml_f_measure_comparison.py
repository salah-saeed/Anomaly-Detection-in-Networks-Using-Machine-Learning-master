
##  "all_data.csv" file is required for the operation of the program.
##  "all_data.csv" file must be located in the same directory as the program.
##The intent of this program is to find the optimal property list for Naive Bayes, and QDA and MLP algorithms.
##It follows a kind of trial-and-error method.
##The feature list obtained from the file "04_2_feature_selection_for_attack_files.py" is placed in the machine learning algorithm to start with the highest importance score.
##If the F-measure for each feature is equal to or greater than the highest value obtained, this property is added to the list. Otherwise it is removed from the list.
##As a result of the process, the program gives the highest F-measure obtained and the property list that provides it
